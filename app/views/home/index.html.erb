  <h4>Security Note Regarding Install Scripts</h4>
  Please be careful about installing untrusted scripts directly from the internet using a command that executes automatically as this script does.
  You should always audit the code to understand what it's doing first, which you can do by
  <a href="/install">viewing the code directly</a>.
  (A <a href="/devices/pretty_print_install">nicer version of the code</a> is also available to view via your web browser.)
  <br><br>
  The LimitOS code is also publicly <a href="https://github.com/llawlor/LimitOS">available on GitHub</a> for viewing.
